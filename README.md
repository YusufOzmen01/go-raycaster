# go-raycaster
A shit ass raycaster that's probably worse than what you can do

Please don't try to implement your own raycaster by referencing this repo. Please. I'm begging you. It will only give pain to you. Since I tried my best not to use any trigonometric functions and proper implementations, I couldn't add stuff like textures. So if you want to make your own raycaster, just google how to do one. I bet you can make one better.
